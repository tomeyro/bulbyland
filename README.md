## BulbyLand

You play as **_Bulby_** the Lightbulb, and your job is to recharge batteries by infusing their power blocks with energy.

Walk on each block to light them up. But if you walk on a lit block, it will turn off, so be carefull where you step.

Some blocks and obstacles can only be activated with specific colors, so use the energy orbs to change Bulby's color.
